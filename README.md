# Prediction-Students-grades-using-Bayesian-Linear-Regression-in-Python

In this notebook, we will implement a complete machine learning project, focusing on Bayesian Inference methods, in particular, Bayesian Linear Regression. We will go through the entire machine learning process, cleaning the data, exploring it to find trends, establishing a baseline model, evaluating several machine learning approaches for comparisons, implementing Bayesian Linear Regression, interpreting the results, and presenting the results.
